Countless popular brands like Shopify, Slack, Salesforce, HubSpot, and Superside have written them, and there appears to be no downside from a traditional ranking or AI citation perspective. Listings also should be updated regularly - 79.1% were last updated in 2025, and 26% were last updated in the past two months alone.",
